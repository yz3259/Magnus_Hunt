          We took inspiration for this game from the treasure hunt tradition in Bath for all new students moved in the city at the beginning of the term. This is a great opportunity to let them
          discover our uni and learn the history of the city. Since the current Covid-19 pandemic prevents students from visiting the campus in person, most of the players will be pleased to
          visit it virtually. We also want to entertain them with some riddles in order to test their knowledge on different subjects.

          Our game is a virtual hunt game located at our University campus. The main goal is to find a Roman treasure hidden in one of the building through a series of riddles. At the beginning
          of the game, the player can choose the total number of riddles to solve and the difficulty levels (easy or difficult). This game will enable the student to stroll around the
          University by clicking on the interactive map to visit different departments and places.

         Our game starts from the Arrivals Square Bus Station, where the player will be assigned an initial score and will be introduced to Professor Max. He will provide you the clues leading
         to a particular location, where a hangman quiz will challenge you. The player has to guess a word related to that department or location. If it turns out too difficult, you will be
         able to ask for different type of hints at cost of losing some points. These will affect the worth of the final reward. After each stage, a password will be unveiled for directing you
         to the next place. Once all the stages have been completed, you will receive the final reward. Enjoy the game ! :)
